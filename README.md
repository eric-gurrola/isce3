=============================================

[![Build Status](https://nisar-ci.jpl.nasa.gov/buildStatus/icon?job=isce-develop)](https://nisar-ci.jpl.nasa.gov/job/isce-develop/)|[![Nightly Build Status](https://nisar-ci.jpl.nasa.gov/buildStatus/icon?job=isce-develop-nightly-build)](https://nisar-ci.jpl.nasa.gov/job/isce-develop-nightly-build/)

This is the Interferometric synthetic aperture radar Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE)
version 3.  Its initial development was funded by NASA's Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO)
under the Advanced Information Systems Technology (AIST) 2008 and is currently being funded under
the NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) project.

ISCE3 is a framework designed for the purpose of processing Interferometric Synthetic Aperture
Radar (InSAR) data.  It has similar gneralgoals to the existing isce2 framework, but it is not a
modification of isce2.  The isce3 frameowrk is being developed from the ground up to support
processing of the flood of data that will be coming from the upcoming NASA-ISRO NISAR mission in just a few years from now.

Further documentation on installing software dependencies and the new framework named pyre are
available for now at https://eric-gurrola.github.io/isce3/.
